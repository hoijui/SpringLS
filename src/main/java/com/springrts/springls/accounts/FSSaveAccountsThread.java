/**
 * Note that it is vital that everything here is synchronized with main server
 * thread.
 * Currently dupAccounts list is cloned from the original accounts list, so we
 * do not have to worry about thread-safety here. This is the easiest way, since
 * otherwise we would have to make sure no account is added or removed while we
 * are saving accounts to disk.
 * The second thing for which we must ensure thread-safety is the
 * Account.toString() method. The only problem there is the call to
 * MapGradeList.toString(), which could potentially cause problems. Other fields
 * used in Account.toString() are mostly atomic, or if they are not, it does not
 * hurt us really - an example is the 'long' type, which consists of two 32 bit
 * <code>int</code>s, and is thus not atomic, but it will not cause corruption
 * in the accounts file, as it is used right now. So it is essential to ensure
 * that the MapGrading class is thread-safe, or at least its toString() method.
